Q.2.What are HTML entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML Entities.

Ans:
HTML entities are a way to represent reserved characters, special characters, and invisible characters in HTML code. Reserved characters such as < and > must be replaced with entities to avoid being mixed with tags. For example, the entity &lt; represents <, and the entity &gt; represents > 1.

HTML entities can be represented using either entity names or entity numbers. Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers. For instance, the entity name &nbsp; represents a non-breaking space, while the entity number &#160; represents the same character.

Some commonly used HTML entities include:

&amp;: ampersand
&lt;: less than
&gt;: greater than
&nbsp;: non-breaking space
&copy;: copyright symbol
&reg;: registered trademark symbol
&euro;: euro currency symbol
